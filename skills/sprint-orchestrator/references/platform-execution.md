# Agent Platform Execution

Use this reference when `sprint-orchestrator` moves an approved sprint from
planning artifacts into Agent Platform worktree agents, monitors lane evidence,
and coordinates CI/CD, review deployments, and handoffs.

The controller coordinates execution. It does not implement lane code, review
its own output, or treat a local terminal as the source of truth.

## Inputs

- Approved sprint plan, plan approval gate, lane map, lane contracts, module
  contracts, and wave release plan when deployment or review evidence is in
  scope.
- `.agent-workflow/sprints/<sprint-id>/execution/sprint-execution-runbook.yaml`
  validated against `../../schemas/sprint-execution-runbook.schema.yaml`.
- Platform readiness and Agent Platform control request artifacts when the
  `add_worktree_agent` MCP/API operation, authorization, or policy decision is
  not already recorded.
- Controller state and session ledger from `controller-loop`.
- GitHub issue, branch, PR, check, deployment, and environment state.

## Platform-First Rules

1. Use the Agent Platform MCP/API identity recorded in the runbook for
   `add_worktree_agent` dispatch and GitHub/poll-based observation.
2. Record policy-sensitive operations as Agent Platform control requests per
   `platform-readiness/references/agent-platform-control.md`.
3. Use GitHub, PR checks, leases, closeout artifacts, and recorded platform
   result refs for routine observation.
4. Do not launch local Claude, Codex, or tmux worker sessions as a substitute
   for Agent Platform dispatch unless a recorded fallback gate authorizes it.
5. Store refs, IDs, paths, concise status, and evidence links. Do not copy raw
   terminal logs, secrets, private prompts, or long session transcripts into
   durable artifacts.

## Build Or Refresh The Runbook

Create the runbook immediately before dispatch:

```bash
skills/sprint-orchestrator/scripts/build_execution_runbook.rb \
  --repo <repository> \
  --sprint <sprint-id> \
  --controller-session-id <controller-session-id>
```

Rebuild or supersede it when sprint plans, lane contracts, wave release plans,
platform readiness, or controller identity change. A stale runbook blocks
dispatch.

Build per-lane Agent Platform `add_worktree_agent` control request stubs from the
runbook before invoking MCP operations:

```bash
skills/sprint-orchestrator/scripts/build_platform_control_requests.rb \
  --repo <repository> \
  --runbook <repository>/.agent-workflow/sprints/<sprint-id>/execution/sprint-execution-runbook.yaml
```

## Dispatch Procedure

For each dependency-ready lane:

1. Confirm the lane has exactly one issue/branch/worktree/PR path unless the
   approved contract documents coupling.
2. Confirm no active worker lease or platform worktree agent already owns the lane.
3. Compile the worker prompt from the approved contract:

   ```bash
   bin/verdify prompt compile \
     --repo <repository> \
     --contract <lane-contract> \
     --role worker
   ```

4. Acquire or confirm local lease/worktree identity only as the lane ownership
   record:

   ```bash
   bin/verdify lane create \
     --repo <repository> \
     --sprint <sprint-id> \
     --lane-id <lane-id> \
     --issue <issue-number> \
     --session-id <platform-session-id-or-pending-id> \
     --agent <agent-platform-worker>
   ```

5. Invoke `add_worktree_agent` through the in-pod controller MCP surface or
   write the required control request before invocation. The redacted request
   parameters must include repository, lane ID, issue, branch, lease/worktree
   ref, prompt ref, contract ref, baseline SHA, allowed paths, validation
   commands, closeout requirements, and protected gate rules.
6. Record the resulting platform worktree-agent ID, prompt manifest, branch, PR,
   issue, lease ID, result refs, and worker status in the execution runbook,
   sprint status, and session ledger.

Never dispatch two worker sessions into the same lane or worktree.

## Controller Poll Loop

Run the configured cadence, typically every five minutes:

1. Refresh GitHub issue, PR, check, deployment, and review state.
2. Refresh lease/worktree state and compare it with lane contracts.
3. Poll GitHub, PR checks, leases, closeout artifacts, and recorded platform
   result refs for heartbeat, status, questions, blockers, closeout, and
   coordination requests.
4. Use terminal access only when separately authorized by a recorded gate and
   never as the durable source of truth.
5. Answer questions that are inside the approved lane contract and delegated
   policy. Open gates for protected decisions.
6. Route closeout to `independent-critic`, critic approval to
   `release-verification` review-inbox mode, CI failure to the owning lane, and
   deployment readiness gaps to `release-verification` or `platform-readiness`.
7. Append controller and session-ledger events for each material transition.

## CI/CD And Review Deployment

- Observe required GitHub checks and workflow runs from GitHub or the CI
  provider. Re-run checks only when policy allows and the reason is recorded.
- Trigger review deployment only when the wave release plan authorizes the
  target environment and the required platform control request or gate is
  satisfied.
- For k3s/GitOps environments, record desired-state refs, namespace, observed
  controller health, deployed revision, rollout status, telemetry refs, and
  rollback path. Runtime verification remains owned by `release-verification`.
- A successful merge or green check does not prove deployment. Route deployment
  proof to the deployment-verification role.

## Delegation And Gates

The controller may answer worker questions and coordinate lanes inside approved
lane contracts. Stop and open a gate for:

- scope, requirement, architecture, public API, schema, data migration, security,
  compliance, or destructive changes;
- production writes, protected environment changes, broad RBAC, or secret
  handling;
- missing or ambiguous Agent Platform `add_worktree_agent` operation identity;
- ambiguous lane, issue, branch, PR, worktree, lease, session, or terminal
  identity;
- stale runbook, stale lane contract, missing GitHub state, missing CI/CD
  evidence, or missing deployment evidence;
- missing platform/GitHub evidence when the worker state cannot be reconstructed
  from durable refs.

## Artifact Updates

Update these records as execution proceeds:

- execution runbook lane session fields and status;
- sprint status and gate artifacts;
- controller state and session ledger;
- Agent Platform control request result refs;
- GitHub PR/check/deployment refs;
- review inbox, diagnostic, release verification, and outcome artifacts through
  the owning downstream skills.
