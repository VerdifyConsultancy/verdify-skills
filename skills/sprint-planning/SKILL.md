description: Selects approved GitHub Issues for a bounded sprint and atomically creates the sprint plan, lane topology, executable lane contracts, review plan, and wave release plan when delivery has CI/CD, preview, deployment, or rollback implications. Use after approved state-of-union strategy identifies ready candidate issues, when planning the next delivery slice, when a user asks what is in, deferred, owned, reviewable, or scheduled for QA/human review, or when an existing sprint must be replanned before dispatch.
compatibility: Requires Git, approved project/module artifacts, and GitHub issue access or a current snapshot. No worktree is created until the complete plan transaction is approved.

# Sprint Planning

Turn backlog problems into an approved, executable sprint transaction. GitHub Issues remain the backlog; the sprint plan records the approved delivery snapshot.

## Default unit

```text
one task (issue) -> one task contract -> one PR -> one fresh-context review
lanes = per-wave write-conflict partitions; tasks converge on the wave branch
```

A **task** (GitHub issue) is the smallest committed, independently reviewable and
mergeable unit and keeps its own PR and fresh critic (ADR-0015). A **lane** is a
temporary, per-wave partition of tasks one worker can own without colliding with
other active writers — derived from the task DAG and file-conflict graph, seeded
from functional areas, not a permanent silo (ADR-0013). The default isolation
guarantee is unchanged: one active worker per worktree/branch (ADR-0003). Couple
tasks in one PR only when inseparable at acceptance and merge boundaries; record
`coupling_justification` and obtain plan approval.

## Rolling-wave planning

Keep complete outcome-level traceability for the roadmap (North Star -> milestone
-> wave) but decompose only the next one or two waves to task-level contracts;
issues are an **output** of planning, not its raw input (ADR-0014). The wave is a
versioned delivery envelope (`../../schemas/wave-contract.schema.yaml`) with
explicit exit gates; tasks are typed (`../../schemas/task-contract.schema.yaml`).
Read `references/rolling-wave-planning.md` for the planning-pass order.

## Prerequisites

- approved project definition;
- approved architecture and relevant module contracts;
- approved or explicitly accepted `NORTHSTAR_PRODUCT.md`,
  `NORTHSTAR_ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `northstar-artifacts.yaml`;
- approved current state-of-union strategy naming candidate issues;
- current GitHub issues, dependencies, and priorities;
- baseline SHA and repository conventions;
- no unresolved decision that invalidates the proposed scope.

## Planning transaction

Perform these steps as one transaction:

1. **Issue readiness.** Verify each candidate issue describes a problem/outcome, acceptance intent, risk, dependencies, and exclusions. Create or propose missing issues rather than inventing private backlog items.
2. **Sprint selection.** Choose a bounded outcome and explicit non-goals. Record milestone/Project links, baseline, acceptance criteria, risks, deployment expectations, and human gates.
3. **Lane topology.** Partition the wave's tasks into lanes from the dependency DAG and expected write-set/file-conflict graph so each lane has one active writer and non-overlapping write scope (ADR-0013). Decide parallel versus serial execution from conflicts and dependency risk, not desired agent count.
4. **Lane contracts.** Compile objective, ownership, dependencies, runtime namespace policy, validation, evidence, Git policy, escalation triggers, and definition of done.
5. **Cross-lane review.** Detect overlapping paths, interfaces, runtime resources, database migrations, and incompatible baselines.
6. **Review and reporting plan.** Record the stakeholder-readable answer:
   included work, deferred work, lane owners, reviewers, responsibility
   summaries, dependency order, QA milestones, human review milestones, review
   packet paths, and user stories that will be completed for review.
7. **Wave release planning.** For deployment-affecting work, record branch or
   merge queue model, required checks/events, CI workflows, preview/review
   environments, GitOps desired state, deployment strategy, observability,
   rollback, release-health signals, and review inbox handoff.
8. **Validation.** Validate the sprint plan, every lane contract, and any wave
   release plan.
9. **Approval.** Present the complete plan, topology, contracts, review plan,
   release plan, risks, and exceptions as one gate. Do not dispatch before
   approval.

Read `references/issue-readiness.md`, `references/planning-method.md`,
`references/lane-transaction.md`, `references/review-and-reporting.md`, and
`references/wave-release-planning.md` as needed.

## Canonical outputs

- `.agent-workflow/sprints/<sprint-id>/sprint-plan.yaml`
- `.agent-workflow/sprints/<sprint-id>/sprint-plan.md`
- `.agent-workflow/sprints/<sprint-id>/lanes/lane-map.yaml`
- `.agent-workflow/sprints/<sprint-id>/lanes/contracts/<lane-id>.contract.yaml`
- `.agent-workflow/sprints/<sprint-id>/gates/plan-approval.yaml`
- `.agent-workflow/sprints/<sprint-id>/release/wave-release-plan.yaml`
  when release/review/deployment evidence is in scope

Use `../../schemas/sprint-plan.schema.yaml`,
`../../schemas/lane-contract.schema.yaml`,
`../../schemas/human-gate.schema.yaml`, and
`../../schemas/wave-release-plan.schema.yaml` when applicable.

## Handoff

After approval, hand off to `sprint-orchestrator`. The orchestrator, not the planner, creates leases/worktrees when dependencies are ready.

## Replanning

If a dispatched lane requires material scope, interface, baseline, or dependency changes, pause affected lanes. Replan the transaction, version changed contracts, record approvals, and reconcile GitHub before resuming.

## Required summary

Before stopping at plan approval, report from the sprint artifacts:

- what is included and what is deferred;
- each lane, issue IDs, owner, reviewer, responsibility, branch, and contract;
- serial/parallel dependency order;
- the next QA milestone and evidence expected;
- the next human review milestone and review packet path;
- which user stories will be completed for review;
- unresolved gates, risks, or exceptions.
