# Controller State Machine

## Required transition data

Every transition needs:

- previous state;
- next state;
- triggering event;
- responsible role;
- required artifacts;
- evidence inspected;
- gates checked;
- child sessions affected;
- rollback or recovery behavior.

## Standard wave states

Use these until an approved project overrides them:

```text

RESEARCH_FANOUT

ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW
DESIGN_REVIEW
DESIGN_COMMITTED
REPO_HYGIENE

HUMAN_REVIEW
FIX_REQUIRED
FIX_WAVE
REPLAN_REQUIRED
PLAN_UPDATE
WAVE_SIGNED_OFF
NEXT_WAVE
NORTH_STAR_PROVEN
IDLE_UNTIL_NEW_REQUIREMENTS
```

Persist wave-supervision state in `.agent-workflow/controller/controller-state.yaml`
with `current_wave` and `waves` entries, and link supervised sessions with
`wave_id`. Do not write standalone `.agent-workflow/controller/waves/<wave-id>.yaml`
artifacts.

## Invariants

- State must survive session restarts.
- A child worker session never self-certifies completion.
- Human feedback blocks protected progression until dispositioned.
- Gravity implementation cannot start unless the Gravity readiness gate is
  approved.
- Controller state references authoritative artifacts rather than duplicating
  their content.
