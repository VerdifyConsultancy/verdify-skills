name: controller-loop
description: Specifies or operates the long-lived Verdify outer loop that persists lifecycle state, wave state, child sessions, gates, status events, and handoffs independently of model conversation history. Use when a project needs resumable orchestration across planning, research, hygiene, sprint execution, review, fixes, replanning, deployment, and human sign-off.
compatibility: Requires approved lifecycle prerequisites, repository artifacts, access to session/runtime records, and Agent Platform API or MCP details when child sessions are actually launched.

# Controller Loop

Own durable orchestration state. Do not implement lane code, review your own
work, or bypass human gates.

## Canonical artifacts

- `.agent-workflow/controller/controller-state.yaml` - durable controller state,
  including current wave and wave-supervision state
- `.agent-workflow/controller/session-ledger.yaml` - append-oriented session map

Validate controller state against `../../schemas/controller-state.schema.yaml`
and the session ledger against `../../schemas/session-ledger.schema.yaml`.
Wave-supervision mode writes wave entries into controller state; do not create
standalone `.agent-workflow/controller/waves/<wave-id>.yaml` artifacts.

## Procedure

1. Read the approved project definition, architecture, module contracts,
   state-of-union, sprint artifacts, gates, and current GitHub state.
2. Reconstruct the current lifecycle state and pending child sessions.
3. Validate the transition against `references/state-machine.md`.
4. For each child loop, record session ID, executor, repository, branch,
   worktree, issue, lane, wave ID, owner, started_at, heartbeat_expectations,
   heartbeat_deadline_at, and stop_condition.
   In wave-supervision mode, record wave entries in controller-state `waves`,
   set `current_wave`, and link sessions to waves with `wave_id`.
5. Launch child sessions only through the configured Agent Platform API, MCP
   tool, or documented manual handoff.
6. Monitor durable events: status, blockers, closeout, critic outcome, CI,
   deployment, review feedback, gate decisions, and session loss.
7. Pause at human gates and protected transitions.
8. Append session-ledger events for lifecycle-significant transitions and
   record explicit exceptions for missing coverage.
9. Write updated controller state and session ledger.

Read `references/session-ledger.md` before creating or reconciling
`.agent-workflow/controller/session-ledger.yaml`.

## Stop conditions

Stop when lifecycle state cannot be reconstructed, an open gate lacks an owner,
session identity is ambiguous, production access is requested directly by a
worker, or the controller would need to make a protected design decision.

## Load references only when needed

- Read `references/state-machine.md` before defining transitions, waves, or
  failure recovery.
