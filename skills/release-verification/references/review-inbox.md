# Review Inbox Packet

Use this reference when a lane, wave, release candidate, or OpenClaw
`sdlc-review-inbox` workflow claims review-ready status.

The review inbox is a promoted capability contract, not a new canonical
lifecycle skill yet. `release-verification` owns the first executable packet
shape because it already separates integration, deployment verification,
rollback, and outcome review.

## Inputs

- North Star IDs, sprint ID, lane IDs, issue IDs, PR or merge request URL, base
  ref, head ref, and exact reviewed head SHA.
- Wave release plan path when present, especially required checks, preview or
  review environment, GitOps desired state, release-health signals, rollback,
  and telemetry expectations.
- Critic report, lane closeout, changed artifacts, test plan, migration notes,
  risk notes, and open human questions.
- Check runs, workflow runs, build artifacts, package validation, local tests,
  security scans, and CI URLs.
- Preview or review deployment URL, environment name, environment protection
  state, deployment ID, observed revision, desired-state ref, reconciliation
  evidence, and deployment logs when applicable.
- Telemetry links: dashboards, logs, metrics, traces, endpoint health, runtime
  checks, and missing-telemetry findings.
- Observability diagnostic packet when runtime evidence is material to the
  review decision.
- Rollback procedure, known-good revision, and rollback evidence.
- Preview generator controls when PR-driven environments are used, including
  source-of-truth ownership, hard-coded project restrictions, secret exposure
  review, and admin-only ApplicationSet or equivalent configuration.

## Procedure

1. Verify the PR or merge request identity and exact head SHA before using any
   check, preview, or critic evidence.
2. Collect required checks and workflow results by name. Do not summarize them
   as "CI passed" without URLs or observed timestamps.
3. Record review or preview deployment evidence separately from merge state.
   Include desired-state refs and observed runtime or reconciliation evidence
   for GitOps-managed environments.
4. Record human test steps and targeted review URLs. If source-to-preview route
   maps exist, include them as reviewer guidance.
5. Review privileged access, secrets, production mutation, and preview generator
   controls. Treat unresolved critical security findings as blockers.
6. Record rollback readiness before marking a packet review-ready.
7. Write `.agent-workflow/sprints/<sprint-id>/review/review-inbox-packet.yaml`
   and validate it against `../../schemas/review-inbox-packet.schema.yaml`.
8. Set the recommendation to `approve`, `request_changes`, `reject`, or
   `escalate`.
9. Route feedback to exactly one next action: fix lane, replan, architecture
   review, release verification, human signoff, issue creation, or hold.

## Completeness Rules

Mark `evidence_completeness.verdict` as `complete` only when:

- PR/MR identity, exact reviewed head SHA, and linked issue/lane/sprint IDs are
  present.
- Required checks have observed statuses, conclusions, and evidence URLs.
- Required preview, review, staging, or production deployment evidence is
  present, or the packet explicitly records a non-environment reason.
- Human test steps are specific enough for a reviewer to execute.
- Telemetry links or missing-telemetry findings are explicit.
- Rollback readiness is recorded.
- Critical security findings are resolved or routed as blockers.

Use `incomplete` for missing non-blocking evidence. Use `blocked` when review
would be misleading or unsafe.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and route to `fix_lane`, `replan`, `architecture_review`, or `hold` when:

- the reviewed head SHA is missing or does not match the PR, checks, critic
  report, or preview deployment;
- required checks or workflow runs are missing or failing;
- a required preview/review deployment is absent or cannot identify the
  observed revision;
- rollback readiness is missing for a release-impacting change;
- secret exposure, broad production mutation, or preview generator controls are
  unresolved;
- the packet would require the reviewer to reconstruct hidden chat context.
